# Graduation Cap
A simple LED sequencer based Graduation Cap

This is a pretty simple LED Graduation cap reference design I made for the upcoming graduation ceremony of my BSEE! It's circuit is based on my [N-Output Sequencer](https://github.com/mkengineering/N_Output_Sequencer) reference design and could be easily modified for other students to use in their own ceremony.

Unfortunatly I wasn't able to get good measurements of the original button that holds the tassel on top of the cap prior to designing the PCB, so the hole I added for it to pass through ended up being too small :cry:. To remedy this, I designed a glue-in 3D printable loop to tie the tassel around. Definitely not ideal but it works great for what it is! Check out the Tassel Holder folder for the solidworks design file and stl!
